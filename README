ofxPd by Example
================

This is a series of examples to show you how to use ofxPd, the puredata 
addon for openFrameworks. The idea is that it is a quick reference for doing
simple stuff with ofxPd.

What you need:

a. a mac (for now)
------------------
Sorry, for now it's mac only.

b. openFrameworks
-----------------
get it here https://github.com/openframeworks/openframeworks
or open a terminal and cd to where you want it and type:

git clone https://github.com/openframeworks/openFrameworks.git


c. ofxPd
--------
get it here: 
https://github.com/danomatika/ofxPd
or likewise
git clone https://github.com/danomatika/ofxPd.git

put the ofxPd folder in the openFrameworks/addons folder with the other addons.

d. ofxPd-by-Example
-------------------
Take the entire folder of the ofxPd-by-Example repository (the one this text file is in)
and put it in the openFrameworks/apps folder.


Examples Walkthrough
===================
Look at testApp.h and testApp.cpp and read the comments.

1. Sine Wave
------------
The first example shows you how to run a patch in openframeworks to generate audio out.
It does nothing special, just a sine wave.

2. Mouse Theremin
-----------------
Mouse theremin is a simple example of how you can control pd by sending messages to it


3. Echo Chamber
---------------
This shows you how to get sound into pd as well as sound out - an effect.

4. Clap Trigger
---------------
This shows how openframeworks can receive messages from pd patches.
